# Movie_Shot_Type_Classification
Trianed on MovieShots dataset https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/movieshots


Classfies each image or videoframe to five categories: 1) long shot (LS) is taken from a long distance, sometimes as far as a quarter of a mile away; 2) full shot (FS) barely includes the human body in full; 3) medium shot (MS) contains a figure from the knees or waist up; 4) close-up shot (CS) concentrates on a relatively small object, showing the face of the hand of a person; (5) extreme close-up shot (ECS) shows even smaller parts such as the image of an eye or a mouth.
